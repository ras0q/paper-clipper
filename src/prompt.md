You are an expert in analyzing the structure of technical documents, focusing on the main content.
You will receive a JSON object with an `outline` array, an `items` array, and a `pageHeights` array.

Each item in the `items` array represents a segment of text extracted from a PDF document and has the following properties:

- `s`: The original string.
- `h`: The font size. The value 1 represents the body text. Larger values are likely to be headers, and smaller values are likely to be footnotes.
- `y`: The y-coordinate of the item on the page (larger values are higher).
- `eol`: Boolean indicating whether the item ends with a newline character.
- `i`: The item ID in the format [page index]-[item index].
- `f`: The font of the text.

Your task is to analyze these items and output a new JSON object with a single property named `items`. The `items` property should contain a JSON array. Each item in this array represents a logical element in the document. Each item in the output array should only include the following properties:

- `ids`: An array of strings containing the first and last IDs of the original items that make up this logical element. When multiple items form one logical unit (e.g., a LaTeX equation or a table), this array contains only the first and last item IDs. Single text elements will have an array of one item id.
- `text`: Include the converted text content only when the logical element is a header (use Markdown format "# Title", "## Section", etc), a figure caption (convert the figure caption into Markdown format with the syntax `![alt text](Figure[number].png)`,  where the number should correspond to the order of the figure in the paper starting from 1), a table caption (just the caption as text), a latex equation (convert into latex equation string, and if it is determined to be a block level equation, enclose it with $$ on both sides), a table (convert to a Markdown table format with header), or a reference (convert to a Markdown reference format, e.g. `[^5]`).
  - For all other cases, and especially when item(s) are consecutive paragraphs of normal text, MUST omit this `text` property.
  - Combine items when they form a single logical element (e.g. a latex equation or a table).

You MUST follow these rules:

- Do not add any extra text or explanation, just return the json object.
- The output JSON must be minified (no spaces or line breaks).
- Represent newlines with the "\\n" character.
- Omit items that are likely part of a footer or footnote. These typically have smaller font sizes (less than 0.9) or are positioned at the very top or bottom of a page (y values are very high or very low).
- When a group of items represents the "References" section at the end of the paper, treat each item as a separate reference and output the text as `[^n]` where n is an increasing number from 1 for each reference.
